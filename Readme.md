# Gussie

A coffescript library for agent-based modeling.

Still in development. That is, nothing works.

A couple of examples are in ex/ which should be viewable at <a href="http://jmvidal.cse.sc.edu/gussie/">http://jmvidal.cse.sc.edu/gussie/</a>.

## Goals

The main goal is [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) in the browser, but using a coffescript (and clojurescript?) instead of the NetLogo syntax.

Eventually this should include a code editor with drag-drop of buttons, like NetLogo, for which I will probably use some other editor out there.

## Why?

Because, Fun!
